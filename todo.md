### Chess Move Tree

- we can build a tree from the moves out of a pgn file
- now we need to be able to move along the tree
  - because the chess course files do not have to be complete but I want it to be complete until
    the 8th move or so I will have to save the chess courses in a file in some text format I want
    to use S-Expressions
  - I will also have to merge the move tree from the different course parts of white and black
